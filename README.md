## Instructions to Run


### Running the Program
To verify a matching solution:
```bash
cd ./src
python3 matcher.py < ../tests/ex.in
python3 performance_Test < ../tests/ex.in
```




### Input Format
- Input files follow the standard stable matching problem format
- First line contains `n` (number of participants)
- Next `n` lines contain preference lists for one group
- Following `n` lines contain preference lists for the other group
- Participants are indexed from 0 to n-1

### Output Format
- Output consists of `n` lines
- Each line `i` contains the index of the participant matched to participant `i`

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x environment
- All packages listed in `requirements.txt` must be installed
- Test files are located in the `tests/` directory
