## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Dependencies
Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- matplotlib (3.10.8)
- numpy (2.4.1)


## Instructions to Run


### Running the Program
To run the algorithm solution:
```bash
cd ./src
python3 matcher.py 
python3 performance_test.py
```




### Input/Output Format
- Input is `n` hospitals/applicants on the first line
- Followed by `n` number of hospitals then `n` number of applicants
- Output is the matched hospitals with the matched applicant 


### Dependencies
- Python 3.x environment
- All packages listed in `requirements.txt` must be installed
- Test files are located in the `tests/` directory

## Task C: Graph and Solution
